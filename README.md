# LAP Challenge: Personalized Spatial Audio Benchmarking

## About
The [LAP Challenge](https://www.sonicom.eu/lap-challenge/) aims at advancing personalized spatial audio technologies. It focuses on enhancing auditory localization and immersion in mixed realities through the personalization of Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs). 

## Challenge Tasks
Participants are encouraged to address one of the following:
- **Task 1:** Normalization of HRTFs for merging different datasets.
- **Task 2:** Spatial upsampling to achieve high-resolution HRTFs from minimal directional samples.

## Key Dates
- Task Details Released: March 27, 2024
- Submission Deadline: June 25, 2024
- Awards Ceremony: August 29, 2024, at EUSIPCO 2024 in Lyon, France.
